        with  clients either  online or  in  person. My  main  responsibilities  were  providing each  client with 
        offerings that would match their expectations, conducting property viewings on request, 
        marketing companyâ€™s services using social media, and meeting sales goals. Other than gaining

        how to manage multiple situations simultaneously.`
